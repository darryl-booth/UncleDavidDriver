## Gameplay

* The game screen is black with an orange frame.
* A winding road with smooth turns stretches from a home icon to a campsite icon.
* A top-down icon of a truck towing a fifth wheel follows the road. The trailer tracks behind the truck.
* A textured half steering wheel appears at the bottom center. Rotate it clockwise or counter-clockwise with touch or mouse gestures to steer.
* Each completed level increases speed by 10%. Leave the road and it's game over with a snarky comment; reach the campsite to advance to the next level.

Have fun!
